When looking for diabetic breakfast ideas, be sure to avoid highly processed foods that are high in carbohydrates. Breakfast is truly the most important meal of the day and for type 2 diabetics, oats is the best option to lower blood sugar levels and keep you feeling fuller for longer.</p>

<p>4 Easy Breakfast Recipes for People With Diabetes As we mentioned before, sprouted bread is ideal. Because a manufacturer labels a food as ‘suitable for diabetics’ doesn’t mean that other food is necessarily unsuitable for diabetics. This leafy green is also an excellent option for diabetics, as it is rich in magnesium, folate and potassium that can help control diabetes. These simple ideas will help keep your blood sugar steady and get you on with your day in no time. Choose roasted mudhi or chuda (puffed rice) with vegetables, instead of chudha upma with oil.</p>
