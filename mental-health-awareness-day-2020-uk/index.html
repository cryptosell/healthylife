<p>Pin on Healthaware May World mental health day is observed on 10 october every year, with the overall objective of raising awareness of mental health issues around the world and mobilizing efforts in support of mental health. World mental health day celebrates awareness for the global community in an empathetic way, with a unifying voice, helping people feel hopeful by empowering them to take action and create lasting change. World mental health day is on october 10 and as our understanding of mental health grows, we grow along with it. If you need someone to talk to then samaritans are available on 116 123 (uk) for free, 24/7. Mental health has come a long way since the early nineties when the world federation of mental health (wfmh) officially established the day.</p>
