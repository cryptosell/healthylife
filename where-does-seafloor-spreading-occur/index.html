<p>Divergent Boundary Seafloor spreading occurs at tectonically divergent plate boundaries, where, not surprisingly, the plates are moving apart (diverging). Basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new sea floor. As the plates split apart, they do so at differing speeds, creating space—anywhere from a few to several hundred miles—between spreading margins. In this the new oceanic crust is formed due to the volcanic activity and the older rocks move away from the mid oceanic ridge. The post how does seafloor spreading occur?</p>

<p>Schematic representation of a subduction zone (right) and Seafloor spreading is the process of molten material from the mantle being pushed upward to the surface of the earth and spreading apart, creating new earth. C, sediments accumulate at the area of spreading. It is a geological process which is caused due to the volcanic activity. This idea played a pivotal role in the development of the theory of plate tectonics , which revolutionized geologic thought during the last quarter of the 20th century.
