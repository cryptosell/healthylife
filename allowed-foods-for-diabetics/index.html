To help make some kind of sense, we present our guide on which foods can help diabetes. It is dangerous for diabetics since it contains 800 calories and also 120g carbs. The american diabetes association says most diabetics can start with 45 g to 60 g of carbohydrate at each meal. These minimal foods don’t need to be counted in the exchange system—you can learn more about the diabetic exchange list here—but there are still a few restrictions.</p>
