<p>Diverticulitis Diet What You Should Eat And Avoid Fiber is an essential nutrient. Here�s a look at how much dietary fiber is found in some common foods. Women should aim for 25 grams of fiber per day, while men should target 38 grams, or 14 grams for every 1,000 calories. Lentils and other beans are an easy way to sneak fiber into your diet in soups, stews and salads. Berries are high in fibre, so try adding fresh blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, or raspberries to your morning cereal or yogurt.</p>
