Oral surgeries leave the mouth extremely tender, wherein the slightest pressure applied on the gums or other parts of the mouth can cause excruciating pain. Skip the crunchy toppings and allow your ice cream to soften a bit rather than eating it directly from the freezer. A soft diet after oral surgery involves liquids and soft foods that are easy to chew and swallow, thereby not causing any strain on the wound and enabling it to heal.</p>
