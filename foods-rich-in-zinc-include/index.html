<p>Top ten zinc rich foods. (With images) Zinc rich foods Eating enough zinc foods boosts your eye health, reduces inflammation, fights oxidative stress, boosts the health of your heart and skin, promotes muscle growth and helps balance your hormones. A cup portion of dates put forward 0.4 mg of zinc. Yogurt, in addition to zinc, is also rich in calcium. A serving of 100 grams of spinach will provide you with 0.53 milligrams of zinc containing 23 calories. Other foods include seeds and nuts, lentils, whole grains, dairy products, and fortified breakfast cereals.</p>
