<p>Kim KW Scharf You will need to quarantine while your exemption is being considered, and you will be required to pay for the quarantine for a period of up to 14 days. Quarantine applies to all overseas travellers, other than travellers flying from new zealand, even if you are currently feeling well. Under public health orders, people who arrive in sydney from overseas or by vessel from another port outside of nsw (other than travellers flying from new zealand) must enter into quarantine in a designated accommodation facility for 14 days. An exemption from quarantine is not the same as a waiver for the quarantine fee. The application is assessed and, if granted by the chief health officer, the traveller, local public health unit and queensland police service are advised.</p>
