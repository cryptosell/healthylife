<p>Tanabata Festival. This is a traditional Japanese holiday Christmas in japan has only really been a thing since the 1960s, when commercialisation after world war ii led to the increasing adoption of american customs over the festive period. Japanese aren�t christian (although even in the us the holiday has deviated away from its christian roots) so if anything is done it is largely a deviation from the western christian roots. Christmas traditions include a variety of customs, religious practices, rituals, and folklore associated with the celebration of christmas.many of these traditions vary by country or region, while others are universal and practiced in a virtually ubiquitous manner across the world. So the holiday break often starts around the 23rd. The emperor�s birthday is a national holiday on the 23rd december and there�s also a new year school break.</p>
