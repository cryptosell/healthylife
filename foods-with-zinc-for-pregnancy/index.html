<p>36 Foods High In Zinc The top 20 foods highest in Zinc The meats that have the highest concentration of zinc include beef, lamb, pork, chicken and turkey. 400 to 1,000 micrograms a day of folate or folic acid before conception and throughout pregnancy If you have a zinc deficiency, then animal foods are better sources of zinc than plant foods.
