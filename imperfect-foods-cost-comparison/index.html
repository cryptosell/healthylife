<p>At Imperfect, we believe that there is no reason to waste They pass the cost savings on to the consumer, making their produce box theoretically less expensive than purchasing from the grocer. We offer imperfect (yet delicious) produce, affordable pantry items, and quality eggs and dairy. Here’s what it would cost for us to buy the same things at conventional produce prices at the grocery store, as close as i can guess. Even with imperfect food ’s service and delivery fee, it was still 28.6% cheaper than regular grocery store pricing. Here are 15 tips for eating healthy on a budget, plus a sample meal plan and grocery shopping list.</p>

Imperfect produce did not save a significant amount of money after shipping costs. Customers can choose from 30 to 40 different produce items each week plus roughly 160 additional items. Discounts average $12 off with a imperfect foods promo code or coupon. I decided to compare imperfect food’s pricing with a grocery store nearest to my home (trader joe’s).</p>
