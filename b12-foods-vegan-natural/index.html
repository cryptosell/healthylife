Vitamin b12 is a complicated vitamin with a unique absorption mechanism and a number of inactive analogs—molecules that appear to be active b12, but actually are not—that possibly interfere with its function. If you are a practicing vegan, supplementation may be the best option for you to ensure you receive adequate to optimal daily intake. If you don’t eat meat, dairy, or eggs, add fortified vegan foods to your diet. Vitamin b12 is generally found in all animal foods except honey while there is no reliable b12 in plant foods, including tempeh, seaweeds, and organic produce.</p>
