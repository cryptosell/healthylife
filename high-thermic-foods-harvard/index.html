Lean proteins and complex carbohydrates are the two food groups that have a higher thermic effect and will increase your metabolic rate more than any other type of food.

Foods high on the glycemic index release glucose rapidly. Chili peppers, protein sources, and green vegetables are among the best foods for boosting metabolism.

It is full of carbs and fiber and therefore has a high thermic effect (though not quite as high as lean proteins). Thermogenic foods may help increase metabolism and calorie burning by enhancing thermogenesis, a process in which the body burns calories to utilize the foods you have just eaten, converting those calories to heat.
