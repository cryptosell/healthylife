<p>Why You Won�t Keep Your New Year�s Resolutions in 2020 There are a few main reasons for that: By the first week, 27% of us abandon our goals. At least 8 times out of 10, you are more likely to fall back into your old habits and patterns than you are to stick with a new behavior. Setting new years resolutions is more fun when you know you can actually keep them. News, approximately 80% of resolutions fail by the second week of february, so the odds are against you.</p>
