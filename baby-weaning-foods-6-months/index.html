Introducing your baby to solid foods, sometimes called complementary feeding or weaning, should start when your baby is around 6 months old. I have collected all baby food recipes which i have posted so far into this post. These provide calcium for growing bones.</p>

<p>Baby led weaning food ideas for 6 month olds! Baby led 10 best weaning foods for your baby. Prior to that point (we started solids at 5 months per her pediatrician), i fed her via spoon or my finger but let her play with chunks of food with her hands, usually at the end of the meal. They are easy to make, nutritious, delicious and most importantly they are all easy for baby to pick up and eat themselves. But make sure you never feed your little one with packaged juices available in the market as they contain all kinds of preservatives and chemicals and are loaded with sugar that can be harmful your baby. Babies tend to be less picky eaters and more accepting of new foods when starting solids through baby led weaning.</p>
