Tea and talk is a great way to come together during this difficult time and have a virtual cuppa with friends.</p>

<p>Pin on Sunflowers and Dandelions From showing love, friendship, and togetherness during national hugging day on january 21, to raising awareness about mental illness like world alzheimer’s month in september, we take mental health seriously and work to bring acknowledgment to all mental health holidays. Below are a few steps you can do to help make observance of world mental health day 2020 become more widespread. We are grateful that ursula ruiz vera chose to share her personal experiences here so that we may consider the individuals who make up large interdisciplinary projects like ripe. National depression screening day is october 8 and world mental health day is october 10. Nami 41 anniversary is today!</p>
