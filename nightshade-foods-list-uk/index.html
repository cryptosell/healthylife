Nightshade foods are staples in many cultures; For example, potatoes are present in potato starch, otherwise known as modified food starch, a common ingredient in many processed foods and a common filler in medications and vitamin supplements. Nightshade fruit and vegetables are for sure a topic close to my heart. A family is subdivided into genera (the plural of genus.) foods in the same genus are even more closely related.</p>
