<p>Pin on How To The term “anxiety” is often used flippantly, but in reality anxiety is a condition that should be diagnosed by a mental health professional. Having an anxiety disorder does more than make you worry. Get a thorough physical exam to make sure other health problems are not fueling your feelings of anxiety. Talk to your doctors, counsellors, and family about all your health problems. In addition, it�s possible to experience physical anxiety symptoms even when no fear or worried thoughts are present.</p>
