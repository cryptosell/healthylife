<p>10 Best Zinc Food Sources for Vegans Level up Your Zinc is available in a wide range of foods, commonly alongside protein, with meat and dairy serving up particularly significant doses. Zinc can, of course, be found in plant sources such as legumes and grains, but they must be consumed in greater quantities. Foods rich in amino acids; Vital wheat gluten, barley, rye, buckwheat, whole grains, and quinoa all have significant amounts of selenium.
