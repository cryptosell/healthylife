<p>Pin on Quick Save Diet Let’s take a closer look at what fiber is, what it does, and how much your dog needs. A recent study showed that dogs fed a high fiber diet lost more than five times the fat mass of dogs fed a low fiber diet 4. Soluble fiber chicory, inulin, fructooligosacharides, pectins, psyllium, plant gums, oats, barley, beet pulp, and some types of fruits and legumes all contain soluble dietary fiber. The roughage and plant matter that they consume provides an important source of fibre for dogs, which helps to balance their diet, keep their digestive system moving, and enhance the energy and nutrients that come from the meat part of their meals. Some soluble fiber foods include oat bran, barley, seeds and legumes like lentils or navy beans.</p>
